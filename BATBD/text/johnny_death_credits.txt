I haven't personally created any of the software included here. I've just tied 
it together in a nice little package - hopefully - easy to use. I'd like to 
use this opportunity to acknowledge here all the people who made this 
possible:

The original team of TiVo hackers, that have put together the original         
      'hacker's way' of adding a second drive, especially TiVoTechie and cc.

Mike Hill aka Mr.Belboz - for having written the BlessTiVo program, the        
      keystone to all subsequent TiVo hacking. 

Dylan, who made it easy for everybody by providing a boot floppy with          
      everything that was needed for the procedure.

fray, for the Quantum unlocking patch.

I'm especially pleased to acknowledge Trevor Heartfield, aka TiVoMad, for his  
     upgrade procedure, as well as his kind collaboration during the beta      
     phase of this CD; he offered part of his time to debug edit_bootparams so 
     that the upgrade works off the CD, too. Thanks, Trevor!

bonehead, for his modified dd that gives feedback - I know some of you will    
     like it. :)

Andrew Tridgell, who made TiVoNet possible :)

Chris Worley, for the TiVoNet setup script.

Peter Anvin, for isolinux.

Patrick Volkerding and the Slackware team, for their wonderful distribution.

And last, but not least, the beta-testers for putting up with my tyranny. The  
     nightmare's over, guys! You know who you are. :) I appreciate your        
     collaboration and suggestions, and your pointing out my stupidity at      
     times. In particular I want to acknowledge DanT, sjf and Worf.
