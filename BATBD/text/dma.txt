So, you want to use DMA with byteswapped drives? :)

Well, you can't have that now, but here's something to bring you as close as 
possible:

Boot with the "dmaswap" option, that'll give you a kernel with DMA enabled and 
the bswap parameters passed to it. The kernel won't do the byteswapping while 
DMA is enabled, though. If you decide you want byteswapping turned on a 
certain drive after boot, it suffices to turn off DMA on the said drive, like 
this:

hdparm -d0 /dev/hdx (will disable DMA on drive x, where x is b. c or d)

Automagically byteswapping will become effective at the same instant. You can 
chech the status with:

cat /proc/ide/hdx/settings

If then you want back the DMA on the drive, just issue:

hdparm -d1 /dev/hdx, and byteswapping will be again off on the drive.
