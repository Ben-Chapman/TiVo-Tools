That is a topic better handled by the TiVo FAQ. Go to the TiVo 
Community Forum at <A HREF="http://www.tivocommunity.com">http://www.tivocommunity.com</A> and read the TiVo 
FAQ. There are lots of helpful people on there and many good 
threads on there to help you understand what your TiVo is all about.

<H2><A NAME="1.3">1.3. Why would I want to hack my TiVo?</A></H2>
Well that depends on you. The biggest reason to hack your TiVo is 
because you want to add more space to it. For example, by adding a 
30GB drive to a 14 hour TiVo you can go from 14 hours of storage 
to 52 hours. Some people want to hack their TiVo just because 
it is fun and they enjoy the hacking experience.

<H2><A NAME="1.4">1.4. Why is the TiVo hackable?</A></H2>
The biggest reason for this is that TiVo used Linux for their 
Operating System. Linux is an open source OS that is widely 
available for many different platforms. The other reason is 
that TiVo uses standard off the shelf IDE hard drives. This 
makes the hard drive upgrade easy since you can go to any 
computer shop and buy an IDE drive.

<H2><A NAME="1.5">1.5. Is this hacking dangerous?</A></H2>
Yes. There are many ``bad'' things that could happen. The TiVo runs 
on AC power so you could electrocute yourself if you touch the power 
supply while the unit is plugged in. Since the power supply is 
unshielded even when unplugged you could still receive a shock! If 
you damage the original hard drive in the TiVo you will render your 
TiVo useless if you have no backup. The other big warning is that 
when you open your TiVo you void your warranty. Do NOT open your 
TiVo unless you understand the risks noted above. Life with TiVo is 
great, but life with a dead TiVo is not!

<H2><A NAME="1.6">1.6. Do I need to learn Linux to hack my TiVo?</A></H2>
Well it depends on what you want to do. If you want to simply add a 
second drive to your TiVo for more storage space, the answer is no. 
If you want to modify the TiVo Linux kernel the answer is yes. The 
best way to answer this question is to read the following sections 
to see what is required for the hack you wish to do.

If you are uncomfortable opening up your PC and adding drives and 
interface cards, your best bet is to avoid this entire procedure. 
If you already know the difference between a primary/slave and 
secondary/master drive setting, you are probably going to really 
enjoy this.

Go to the TiVo Underground forum at <A HREF="http://www.tivocommunity.com">http://www.tivocommunity.com</A>. The 
best way though is to load up your favorite IRC client and join the 
#tivo channel on irc.openprojects.net. Many people involved in 
hacking the TiVo chat in there.
<P>
(Note: this channel is for hacking discussion, for questions, please try
#tivo-newbies on the same irc network.)

NO NO NO. This is something that will NOT be explored. TiVo has been 
very gracious in not coming down on all this hacking described in 
this FAQ and we will do nothing to harm that. Nothing will be looked 
at to get around the subscription service so don't ask! Regardless 
your TiVo will function as a VCR already with manual record mode.

<H2><A NAME="1.12">1.12. So who are all the people I have to thank for the TiVo hacking?</A></H2>
Well here are just some of the people involved. Feel free to email me 
those I forgot. 
<P>
cc, Peter Creath, TivoTechie, and Ron Curry were the guys to 
figure out originally how to add a second drive to a TiVo. It 
all started with these guys. Many of these guys are working on 
other projects such as understanding the MFS format, expanding 
the A drive, etc. If it was not for the work these guys did 
(and continue to do) none of this hacking would happen as soon 
as it did. 
<P>
Dylan created a Linux boot floppy that contains the programs 
and utilities needed to make a backup of your TiVo A drive. 
This disk also contains Mike's BlessTiVo program on it. Dylan 
has been working on a program to automated turning on or off 
many of the special hacks noted in this FAQ. 
<P>
Andrew Tridgell has developed a PAL kit for the TiVo.  With his
software (see section 4.1) your TiVo can except PAL video. He also
donated space on one of samba.org servers to host this FAQ.  Andrew is 
the creator of the infamous Samba!  Go to <A HREF="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</A> for more 
information.
<P>
Mike Hill (aka Belboz) wrote the BlessTiVo program that 
automates the ``blessing'' process to add a second drive. He 
also wrote a program (osdmngr) to convert Targa files to and 
from cs22 files for creating On Screen Displays for the TiVo. 
He compiled the Joe text editor and MicroCom Terminal program 
for the TiVo also. The osdmngr, joe, and microcom can be found 
at <A HREF="http://tivo.samba.org/download/belboz">http://tivo.samba.org/download/belboz</A> . (I am also one of the many who edit this FAQ)

<H1>2. Backing up your TiVo</H1>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2.1">2.1. What do I need to open up my TiVo?</A></H2>
The following equipment is needed. 
<P>
Torx #10 screwdriver. You can find one at almost any hardware store. 
(Sears and Lowes had them in my area). The TiVo uses special Torx 
screws for the case and drive. Don't try using a regular flat head 
screwdriver or you will end up stripping the screws out and making 
the upgrade more difficult.

<H2><A NAME="2.2">2.2. How do I open my TiVo?</A></H2>
Unplug your TiVo and allow time for the hard drive to stop spinning 
before moving it. 
<P>
Remove the three Torx screws on the back of the TiVo. The top lid 
should slide off. It is on very tight. Some people have used a flat 
head screwdriver to pry under the top of the case where the screws 
in the back were removed. Take your time. 
<P>
Remember to avoid touching the power supply since you can be shocked 
even with it unplugged.

<H2><A NAME="2.3">2.3. What is all this cool stuff in the TiVo I see?</A></H2>
Well looking at the insides of your TiVo from the front you see the 
following items. 
<P>
The board on the far left is the main circuit board. This board 
contains things like the CPU, MPEG decoder chip, modem, etc. This 
is the brains of your TiVo unit. 
<P>
The top right of the unit is the power supply. This supplies power to 
the main circuit board and to the hard drive(s) . 
<P>
To the bottom right you will see either one or two hard drives. Most 
units will have only one drive.

<H2><A NAME="2.4">2.4. Why should I make a backup?</A></H2>
Well there are numerous reasons you should make a backup 
<P>
If something goes wrong and you damage your original A drive your 
TiVo is now useless 
<P>
If you are upgrading your TiVo capacity by adding a second drive 
it can not be removed once added. If you pull a second drive from a 
TiVo once it has been added, the TiVo will no longer boot up. 
<P>
If TiVo changes something in future software revisions it is possible 
user hacked units may stop working or just do ``weird things''. If 
this would happen a backup gets you back to your original state. 
<P>
Even if you don't hack your TiVo a backup of the A drive could be 
handy if your TiVo A drive dies down the road and your unit is out
of warranty.  You could purchase a new drive and restore your backup
onto that drive.
<P>
It is the smart thing to do so do it!

<H2><A NAME="2.5">2.5. When should I make a backup?</A></H2>
Well the ideal time is with a TiVo that has never been powered up. Getting a backup in this ``virgin'' state is ideal. The problem with this is you are going to void your warranty on a new TiVo you have
never used. Some people don't mind this, but if your TiVo modem is fried and you don't use your TiVo first you will never know until after you voided your warranty. If you are going to make a backup
to file a virgin TiVo is ideal because many people have been able to compress their virgin TiVo A drives down to a file small enough to compress onto a single CDR (less than 650MB). Newer units
with the demo mode only compress down to a file about 3GB or so which is still small enough to fit on 5 CD's. If the TiVo has actually been in use it will not compress well and could take dozens of
CD's for a backup.

<H2><A NAME="2.6">2.6. I have two TiVo units can I just backup one unit?</A></H2>
Yes and no. The best rule of thumb is to do a backup for each unique 
model TiVo you own. For example if you have a Sony and a Philips 
model you should backup each since the units are different.
<P>
One VERY important thing also. If you have a unit that has a serial 
number that starts with 002 and you don't back it up and restore 
an image from a non 002 unit which has version 1.2.1 or lower of
the TiVo software you will run into problems. The TiVo service will 
still assume your 002 unit has 1.3 and will not upgrade the software 
to 1.3. You will also tick TiVo off when your unit is calling in with 
software that has not been installed on that unit. TiVo has been very 
kind initially when things like this happened, but it is better to not 
rock the boat. If you want to share a backup between multiple TiVo's 
you own, make sure they all have the same version software installed 
from the factory.
<P>
Update!!!
<P>
Do NOT use a backup of a Philips unit on a Sony or vice versa.  The TiVo 
servers will get mixed up and TiVo will terminate your account.
<P>
With all the new units coming out this is a very important issue.  So just 
remember to do a backup for each unit you hack UNLESS they are the EXACT 
same unit and EXACT same revision software.  If you do otherwise you 
risk losing your TiVo service and or ticking TiVo off.
<P>
If you are unsure on this subject go to <A HREF="http://www.tivocommunity.com">http://www.tivocommunity.com</A> 
and ask there before you proceed.

The following things are needed. 
<P>
Follow the procedures noted in section 2.1 to open the actual TiVo 
unit up. 
<P>
A backup program of some type to backup the ``A'' drive in the TiVo. 
See section 2.9 for more information.

<H2><A NAME="2.8">2.8. I want to make a backup, but how do I do it?</A></H2>
Smart choice! Well there are a couple ways to do it. 
<P>
You can buy an extra drive and make a complete backup of your original 
A drive onto the new drive. This way you can pull the original A drive 
out and store it for safe keeping and run using the new backup A 
drive. Remember that your drive needs to be large enough to hold the 
copy. So if you have a TiVo with a 30GB Quantum as the A drive, you 
should buy a 30GB drive as the backup drive. I recommend getting the 
same drive as your original A drive so that you ensure your copy will 
fit. Some people bought a Western Digital 15GB drive for backing up 
their 15GB Quantum in the TiVo only to find out the Western Digital 
was actually a tiny bit smaller and they couldn't make a backup. 
<P>
You can also make a backup to a file or series of files onto another 
drive. You could keep them on that drive or possibly burn them onto 
CDROM's if you have a CDR or CDRW drive. The benefit to the backup to 
file method is that you do not have to worry about drive model type. 
As long as your drive is large enough to hold the image you are fine.

<H2><A NAME="2.9">2.9. I bought an extra drive for my A drive backup how can I make a copy of it?</A></H2>
There are currently three recommended programs to do this with. Two are 
DOS programs named Dolly and DiskPro Lite. The third is a Linux boot 
disk put together by a member of the TiVo community (Dylan). It is 
recommended to use the Linux boot disk. It has proven more reliable 
than the DOS programs. These first steps must be done regardless of 
which program you wish to use for the backup. 
<P>
1.Unplug your TiVo and allow time for the hard drive to stop spinning 
before moving it 
<P>
2.Open up your TiVo. 
<P>
3.Remove the IDE connector and power cable from the back of the drive 
in the TiVo. Be careful to not touch the power supply. 
<P>
4.Remove the two Torx screws from the front of the plate the drive is 
mounted to. The drive should then lift up from the front and easily 
be removed from the TiVo. 
<P>
5.Power off your PC and open up the case. Connect the original TiVo A 
drive to the Secondary IDE channel on your motherboard. Take your new 
backup drive and make sure it is set as the slave drive. This will 
vary depending on your drive type. See the manufacturers documentation 
for details. Connect it to the cable connected to the Secondary IDE 
channel also. This will make your original TiVo A drive the master on 
the Secondary IDE connector, and the backup drive will be the Slave on 
the Secondary IDE connector. Make sure each drive also has a power 
connector plugged into it. Unplug ANY devices from the Primary IDE 
port. This is VERY important if you use Dolly to do the copy. 
<P>
6.Power up your PC and go into your CMOS. This varies depending on 
the computer's BIOS. Some systems require hitting the delete key on 
power up, some F10, and some the escape key. If you don't know you 
will need to check your computers documentation. In the CMOS make sure 
the Secondary Master and Slave drives are set to AUTO. If your BIOS 
does not have an AUTO settings you can sometimes have the BIOS detect 
the drives for you. Save your settings and reboot. 
<P>
7.Make sure your PC detects the drive sizes correctly. If your CMOS 
reports either drives capacity wrong then DO NOT continue. Some things 
to check if the drive is not detected correctly.
<P>
Your computer may be an older model and has trouble with large 
drives. Find a system with a newer BIOS capable of handling large 
drives. If your using the Linux boot disk you can turn off the CMOS 
settings for the drives.  Linux can detect the drives automatically 
without the CMOS settings.  This allowed my Pentium 166 to detect 
a 60GB Maxtor drive.  The CMOS on the Pentium 166 would lock the system 
up if I let it try to detect the drive.
<P>
The drive is locked. If the CMOS reports something like 19 cylinders, 
16 heads, 63 Sectors you have a locked drive. Those numbers were 
reported by a user with a locked 30GB Quantum A drive in his TiVo. See
the sections below on how to deal with locked drives.
<P>
If the capacity for each drive is detected correctly then you may 
proceed to the approriate sections below depending on which backup 
program you are using.

<H2><A NAME="2.10">2.10. How do I make a disk to disk backup with Dolly?</A></H2>
The following are the steps needed to backup your original TiVo A 
drive to a new drive. If the new drive is a Quantum also it will be 
bootable in your TiVo. The below steps assume you have the drives 
connected as described in section 2.9 above. It should be noted that Dolly 
detects xhd128 as the first hard drive the BIOS sees and not 
necessarily the Primary Master drive. Make sure you have disconnected 
all drives from the Primary IDE connector on your motherboard. 
Failure to do so could cause you to erase those drives or your TiVo 
drive. 
<P>
1.Download Dolly at the following address <A HREF="ftp://ftp.bke.hu/pub/mirrors/sac/utildisk/dolly.zip">ftp://ftp.bke.hu/pub/mirrors/sac/utildisk/dolly.zip</A> 
<P>
2.Format a bootable floppy and extract the files from the dolly archive 
to it. Do NOT run Dolly from inside Windows or from a DOS window. 
<P>
3.Boot your computer with the floppy in the drive. Make sure your 
computers boot up screen (Post screen) detects the drives fine. 
<P>
4.Type the following command from the A prompt 
``dolly xhd128: xhd129: /c'' (do not type the quotes) 
<P>
5.After that command is finished type the following 
``dolly xhd128: xhd129:`` (do not type the quotes) 
<P>
6.Make sure there were NO error messages or problems with the copy 
process. If there was you should go back through these steps here 
and make sure you followed every step. If it fails again, your 
likely problem is smaller destination drive. 
<P>
7.After the last command finishes you can turn off your computer, 
wait for the drives to spin down and you are done! 
<P>
This process can take HOURS to run. Do not be alarmed if it takes 
awhile. Once finished you can either boot your new copied A drive if 
it is a Quantum and store your original drive for safe keeping. If 
your new drive is a non quantum you will need to put your original 
A drive back in and keep the new drive as your backup.

The following are the steps needed to backup your original TiVo A 
drive to a new drive. If the new drive is a Quantum drive it will be 
bootable in your TiVo without need for the "runideturbo" setting 
described in later sections. The steps below assume you have the drive 
connected as described in section 2.9 above. 
<P>
1.Download DiskPro Lite from <A HREF="http://www.fitusa.com/freesoft.htm">http://www.fitusa.com/freesoft.htm</A>. You 
want to download the DPCR.EXE file. 
<P>
2.Execute the DPCR.EXE file to extract the files from it. 
<P>
3.Format a bootable DOS floppy. Copy the diskpro.exe file to the floppy. 
<P>
4.Boot your PC with the newly made floppy in the drive. 
<P>
5.At the DOS prompt type ``diskpro'' and hit enter (no quotes) 
<P>
6.Use the Quick Copy option 
<P>
7.Select your source drive 
<P>
8.Select your destination drive 
<P>
9.Make sure the above choices are correct before starting the copy 
<P>
10.Relax while the drive is copied to a new drive. A user with a 14 hour A drive reported this copy took about one hour. Your mileage may vary.

<H2><A NAME="2.12">2.12. How do I make a disk to disk backup with Dylan's Boot Disk?</A></H2>
Dylan's boot disk is a ``Linux on a floppy'' that one of the AVS 
members (Dylan in case you didn't guess!) put together. It has 
everything on it you need to make either a disk to disk copy of a 
TiVo A drive, or a disk to image copy. It also contains Mike Hill's 
BlessTiVo program which will be described in later sections. The 
process to do this is as follows. 
<P>
1.Download Dylan's disk at the following site 
<A HREF="http://www.tivofaq.com/hack">http://www.tivofaq.com/hack</A>. 
<P>
2.Extract the files from the archive. Get a blank formatted floppy 
ready and run the batch file from the archive. It will prompt you to 
insert a floppy in drive A, and it will create the boot disk for you. 
<P>
3.Reboot the PC with the floppy diskette in the A drive. 
<P>
4.Once the floppy has booted you will see a login prompt. Login as 
``root'' (no quotes) and hit enter. 
<P>
5.Type the following command to make your image. This assumes you have 
the drives connected to your PC as described in section 2.9 above. Do 
NOT connect either drive to the Primary IDE channel as the master drive. 
It will NOT work. Connect them as detailed here unless you know what 
you are doing. 
<P>
6. "dd if=/dev/hdc of=/dev/hdd bs=32k" (no quotes)
<P>
If that command eventually returns an error, use this one instead.
"dd conv=noerror,sync if=/dev/hdc of=/dev/hdd bs=32k" 
<P>
7.This can take a LONG time. The dd program does not give any visual 
feedback until it is finished. You hard drive activity light should 
show activity though through the entire process. The backup time can 
take any ware from 2-8 hours. The time varies due to drive size, CPU 
speed, etc. 
<P>
8.Make sure when the command is finished that no errors were reported. 
The program should report X number of blocks in and X numbers of blocks 
out. These numbers should be equal. If there were errors, you need to 
go back through this section and see if you skipped a step. 
<P>
9.Turn off the PC and wait for the drive to spin down. Your backup is complete.

Nowhere! This would violate TiVo's copyrights. If you want a backup 
you are going to have to make it yourself. If your unit has been in 
use for awhile this is going to be a large backup. Your best bet 
in this situation is to just buy an extra drive and do a sector to 
sector copy of the original.

2. Make sure the PC's CMOS is set to AUTO for the locked drive.
<P>
3. Boot up with the dos floppy you prepared in step 1.
<P>
4. Run the DLGCHK program. Just press Enter on all the screens until 
you exit.
<P>
5. Insert your disk with your backup program of choice (the Linux boot 
disk, Dolly, or Diskpro Lite).
<P>
6. Reset the computer (do not power it off).  Hit CTRL-ALT-DEL, or hit 
the reset button.

<H2><A NAME="2.16">2.16. Can I make a backup with my TiVo instead of a PC?</A></H2>
Yes. This is actually a good method for people with locked drives who 
don't have a PC clone. You can only do a drive image copy with this 
method. Here are the steps needed. 
<P>
1.While the TiVo is powered off and unplugged you need to connect 
your blank drive into your TiVo as the B drive (set the jumpers to 
slave for this drive). This new drive will contain a complete image 
of your A drive when finished. 
<P>
2.You need to be able to access the TiVo diagnostic menu detailed 
in section 4.3. If your system does not support the factory 
password you must use one of the other methods of backup. 
<P>
3.You need to enable the Bash prompt as detailed in sections 4.4-4.6. 
<P>
4.Type the following from the bash prompt 
<P>
5."/devbin/dd conv=noerror,sync if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb bs=32k" 
(no quotes) Note if this fails with a message about "dd not found" 
proceed to step 6. If the command works skip to step 7. 
<P>
6.You need to mount the partition with dd. Type the following. 
"mount /dev/hda4 /mnt" (no quotes). Then type 
"/mnt/devbin/dd conv=noerror,sync if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb bs=32k" 
(no quotes). If this command still fails with the "dd command not found" 
message, your unit does not have a devbin directory, and you can not do 
a backup with your TiVo. Proceed to step 9 if the dd command failed 
in this step.
<P>
7.Let the process run to completion. Depending on the size of the drive 
this could take 4-8 hours. 
<P>
8.When completed make sure there were no errors. 
<P>
9.If you had to use step 6 above type the following ``umount /mnt'' 
<P>
10.Turn off the TiVo and remove the B drive. 
<P>
11.You now have a complete image of your TiVo A drive.

<H2><A NAME="2.17">2.17. How do I make a backup to a single compressed file on another hard disk?</A></H2>
To do this type of backup you will need Dylan's boot disk, your original 
A drive to backup and a DOS FAT formatted hard drive to put the backup 
on. The drive needs to have enough space to hold the backup. It should 
be noted that if your TiVo has been used much the backup will be 
exceedingly large and doing a disk to disk image is generally a better 
idea. If the A drive is from a virgin TiVo this compressed image could 
be anywhere from 600MB to 20GB. The size will vary even for virgin TiVo's 
because some have the store demo mode on them and some don't. For the 
example below we will assume the following drive connections. 
<P>
<PRE>
 Original A drive connected to secondary port as the master drive ( /dev/hdc ) 
 DOS/Windows formatted drive connected to Primary port as the master 
  drive ( /dev/hda ). The partition can be either a FAT16 or FAT32
  partition. Dylan's bootdisk does support Ext2 partitions also if 
  you wish to use one. 
 Do not connect the DOS/Windows drive to anything but Primary master. 
  Byte swapping is used for all other devices and Linux will not be 
  able to mount DOS partition connected to them. 
</PRE>
(Note: The following will almost always give an error since Dylan's bootdisk does not support files larger than 4 gig. We recommend you use the split file or disk to disk method).
<P>
The following are the steps needed to do the backup. 
<P>
<PRE>
    1.Connect the drives as stated above 
    2.Boot the computer with Dylan's boot disk in the floppy drive 
    3.Login in as root 
    4.Type "mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt" (no quotes) 
    5.Type "dd if=/dev/hdc bs=32k | gzip -9c &gt; /mnt/tivodisk.gz" (no quotes).
    Use "dd conv=noerror,sync if=/dev/hdc bs=32k | gzip -9c &gt; /mnt/tivodisk.gz" (no quotes) if the first gives an error.
    6.Go relax because this will take awhile. Depending on the speed of
      the computer, size of the A drive, this could take anywhere from 
      3 to 24 hours! 
    7.When finished make sure there were no errors. 
    8.Type "umount /mnt" (no quotes) 
    9.Power down the PC. 
</PRE>
To restore the backup do the following. Remember that this will erase whatever is on the drive connected to the secondary master port. 
<P>
<PRE>
    1.Connect the drives as stated above 
    2.Boot the computer with Dylan's boot disk in the floppy drive 
    3.Login in as root 
    4.Type "mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt" (no quotes) 
    5.Type "cat /mnt/tivodisk.gz | gzip -d -c | dd of=/dev/hdc 
      bs=32k" (no quotes) 
    6.Go relax because this will take awhile. Depending on the speed of
      the computer, size of the A drive, this could take anywhere from

<H2><A NAME="2.18">2.18. How do I split a compressed backup into smaller files onto another hard disk?</A></H2>
This type of backup is typically done by those who want to split the 
archive into smaller chunks to fit on a CDR or to avoid the 2GB file 
size limitation. To do this type of backup you will need Dylan's boot 
disk, your original A drive to backup and a DOS FAT formatted hard 
drive to put the backup on. The drive needs to have enough space to 
hold the backup. It should be noted that if your TiVo has been used 
much the backup will be exceedingly large and doing a disk to disk 
image is generally a better idea. If the A drive is from a virgin TiVo 
this compressed image could be anywhere from 600MB to 20GB. The size 
will vary even for virgin TiVo's because some have the store demo 
mode on them and some don't. For the example below we will assume the 
following drive connections. 
<P>
<PRE>
 Original A drive connected to secondary port as the master drive ( /dev/hdc ) 
 DOS/Windows formatted drive connected to Primary port as the master 
  drive ( /dev/hda ). The partition can be either a FAT16 or FAT32 
  partition. Dylan's bootdisk does support Ext2 partitions also if 
  you wish to use one. 
 Do not connect the DOS/Windows drive to anything but Primary master. 
  Byte swapping is used for all other devices and Linux will not be 
  able to mount DOS partition connected to them. 
</PRE>
The following are the steps needed to do the backup. 
<P>
<PRE>
    1.Connect the drives as stated above 
    2.Boot the computer with Dylan's boot disk in the floppy drive 
    3.Login in as root 
    4.Type "mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt" (no quotes) 
    5.Type "dd if=/dev/hdc bs=32k | gzip -9c | split -b 650m - /mnt/tivodisk_" (no quotes).
    Use "dd conv=noerror,sync if=/dev/hdc bs=32k | gzip -9c | split -b 650m - /mnt/tivodisk_" (no quotes) 
    instead, if the first command gives you an error.
    6.In the step above 650m denotes 650 Megabytes. This size file 
      should fit on a CD later for burning. You can make this value 
      whatever best suits your needs. 
    7.Go relax because this will take awhile. Depending on the speed of 
      the computer, size of the A drive, this could take anywhere from 
      3 to 24 hours! 
    8.When finished make sure there were no errors. 
    9.Type "umount /mnt" (no quotes) 
   10.Power down the PC. 
</PRE>
To restore the backup do the following. Remember that this will erase whatever is on the drive connected to the secondary master port. 
<P>
<PRE>
    1.Connect the drives as stated above 
    2.Boot the computer with Dylan's boot disk in the floppy drive 
    3.Login in as root 
    4.Type "mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt" (no quotes) 
    5.Type "cat /mnt/tivodisk* | gzip -dc | dd of=/dev/hdc obs=32k" (no quotes) 
    6.Go relax because this will take awhile. Depending on the speed of 
      the computer, size of the A drive, this could take anywhere from 
      3 to 24 hours! 
    7.Make sure there were no errors reported 
    8.Type "umount /mnt" (no quotes) 
    9.Power down the PC

<H2><A NAME="2.19">2.19. Why can't I use Ghost or Drive Image to backup my drive?</A></H2>
These programs examine the partition information of all drives 
connected. Since the TiVo disks use their own partition type and it 
is byte swapped, programs like Ghost only allow the TiVo drive to be 
a target drive for a copy (which is NOT what you want). You basically 
need a disk copy program that does a sector by sector copy only. It is 
recommended that you stick with one of the programs detailed in 
previous sections. 
<P>
The latest Ghost 6.5 was tested by various people and was proven 
not to work. The raw sector copy mode was tried also.
<P>
Many people assume that since Ghost supports Linux ext2 partitions now 
that it will work with a TiVo.  It should be noted that the TiVo Linux 
partitions are not standard ext2 format.  They are slightly modified 
and are byte swapped.  The TiVo disk also contains 2 MFS partitions which
are not ext2 format and the format is unknown at this time.

<H2><A NAME="2.20">2.20. Can I zero out certain partitions to make my backup to file smaller?</A></H2>
Not currently. If you have a virgin TiVo that has never been powered 
up you will get the smallest backup to file possible (if you use 
compression). Once the TiVo has been in use though it will store all 
the MPEG encoded video on the drive. This MPEG data will not compress 
any further when a backup is done. Once we get a better understanding 
of the TiVo partitions a selective backup may be possible.

No, this will not help.  
<P>
The reason being you are feeding a static ANALOG picture into the TiVo 
which is then decoding it with an Analog to Digital converter.  Because 
of this you will not get static data from the MPEG compression.

Yes you can. Some people have trouble finding the Quantum 15GB drive 
used in the TiVo 14 hour unit and are purchasing a 30GB Quantum. You 
can copy your TiVo A drive to a larger drive and it will run in your 
TiVo, but it will only look like the original size drive to the TiVo. 
<P>
So if you copy a 15GB TiVo A drive to a 30GB drive the 30GB drive 
will look like a 15GB drive to the TiVo.

<H2><A NAME="2.25">2.25. I want a virgin backup, but I want to be sure my TiVo is good before cracking the case!</A></H2>
If you are worried that there may be something wrong with your TiVo 
(the modem for instance) and want to test it before backing it up 
(which requires opening the case and voiding your warranty) here is 
what you can do. Connect your TiVo to your TV, Cable Box/Antenna, and 
phone line as detailed in the TiVo manual. Power up the TiVo. Proceed 
into guided setup and make the first initial test call. Once the call 
is completed ``DO NOT'' proceed on with the final call (the program 
call). Just power down the TiVo and proceed with the backup 
instructions. This test proves that your TiVo powers up, can output 
video to your TV, and the modem works. This test is not 100 percent, 
since you are not testing things like the TV recording, or cable box 
control. But it does test many things (the modem being the most 
important). If you still don't feel comfortable then you should 
probably configure and use your TiVo like normal until you are happy 
and just backup the A drive to another drive as detailed in latter 
sections below.

<H2><A NAME="2.26">2.26. Why are some virgin unit backups less than 650MB and others 20GB??</A></H2>
Originally the large difference was thought to be because of the demo 
mode in newer units.  But with some backups of virgin (never powered up 
units) taking 20 Gigabytes and others taking less than 650 Megabytes 
this theory doesn't seem to hold water.
<P>
The actual reason for this is that at the factory Philips and Sony 
actually do a test recording of a TV signal.  On some units this test recording can be quite small and on others it has been quite long.  Some units don't seem to have any test video (more than likely the &lt; 650MB backups) at all.
<P>
A 14 hour virgin drive was backed up with compression to a 2.7GB file. 
When examining the drive there was about 45 minutes of "Fox Kids 
Cartoons" from Channel 2 in San Francisco.  
<P>
So even though the virgin backup could be a gamble on how big the 
backup will be, it is still recommended that it be tried if possible. A 
3GB backup is much better than a 20GB.

<H2><A NAME="2.27">2.27. Using rsync to transfer files to/from your TiVo</A></H2>
Getting data onto and off your TiVo is made a lot easier using
rsync. You can get a tivo binary of rsync from
<A HREF="http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge">http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge</A>/ then you need to follow these
steps to use it:
<P>
1) Setup PPP to your TiVo as described in Section 4.27. Make sure you can ping.
<P>
2) install rsync as a daemon on your Linux box (_not_ on the tivo). To
do this you add a line like this in /etc/inetd.conf:
<P>
<PRE>
   rsync stream tcp nowait root /usr/bin/rsync rsync --daemon
</PRE>
then send a HUP to inetd like this "killall -1 inetd"
<P>
3) create a /etc/rsyncd.conf something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
	  [tivo]
		path = /tmp/tivo
		uid = root
		read only = no
</PRE>
You may wish to set "uid=" to your own username rather than root. Then
do "mkdir /tmp/tivo" as that user.
<P>
NOTE: If you are on a open internet connection then the above will
have opened the directory /tmp/tivo to the world. See the rsyncd.conf
man page for security options.
<P>
4) test your rsync setup locally (ie. without the TiVo). Use a command
like:
<PRE>
        rsync -Pavz /etc/hosts localhost::tivo/
</PRE>
5) copy the TiVo rsync binary to your TiVo (maybe using http_get).
<P>
You can now transfer files betweem /tmp/tivo on your linux box and
your tivo. Note that you must use the IP address if your Linux box in
the rsync commands, the host name will not work. See the rsync man
page for all the options, but the following will give you some ideas:
<P>
<PRE>
     rsync -Pavz /var/log 192.168.2.22::tivo/
     rsync -Pav 192.168.2.22::tivo/foo /tmp/

<H2><A NAME="2.28">2.28. Why are people in the Underground calling me a MORON?</A></H2>
This refers to two posts made by Richard Bullwinkle (a TiVo Representative) in the Tivo Underground hacking forum at <A HREF="http://www.tivocommunity.com">http://www.tivocommunity.com</A> .
<P>
A Type I Moron is someone who takes a box that came with some version of software (1.3, for example), and restores a backup of an earlier version of software (1.21, for example). The result of this is that the box will not upgrade itself to the latest version of software, without TiVo manually intervening and forcing it. However, some people did this and caused TiVo a lot of confusion trying to figure out why the boxes had 1.21 on them in the first place. See <A HREF="http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/000906.html">http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/000906.html</A> for more details.
<P>
A Type II Moron is someone who takes a drive from a Philips unit and uses the image or the drive itself in a Sony unit, or vice-versa. While this will appear to work at first, what will happen is that the TiVo servers will see that the software version is incorrect, and try to update the unit. However the update will fail due to differences between the two units. Thus, every daily call will try an update, thus costing TiVo a lot for the phone calls, and eventually disabling your service to make it stop. They cannot fix this remotely by forcing it to upgrade or anything, so just don't do it. See <A HREF="http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/001799.html">http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/001799.html</A> for more details.

There are a couple ways to do it. The easiest is to download Dylan's

included on the disk. There is the original way which requires more 
work but is more fun for the ``hacker'' crowd. Both will be

The answer is yes and no. These are the current upgrade issues. 
<P>
Any single drive TiVo is upgradeable by adding a second drive. If you 
have a 30 hour two drive unit you cannot remove the 2nd drive and add 
a new larger drive. The only way to upgrade a 2 drive unit currently 
is to buy a new TiVo that has a single drive and either upgrade it or 
copy its A drive onto a new A drive for insertion into your old TiVo.

<H2><A NAME="3.3">3.3. What type of drive do I need to add to my TiVo?</A></H2>
Well currently there have been four manufacturers of drives that have 
been used to upgrade a TiVo. Here is a breakdown on known working 
drives from those manufacturers. 
<P>
1.Quantum 15GB Fireball LCT10 5400 RPM. This drive adds roughly 15 hours of capacity. 
<P>
2.Quantum 30GB Fireball LCT10 5400 RPM. This drive adds roughly 38 hours of capacity. 
<P>
3.Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 30GB 5400 RPM. This drive adds roughly 38 hours of capacity. 
<P>
4.Western Digital Caviar 30GB 5400RPM. This drive adds roughly 38 hours of capacity. 
<P>
5.Maxtor Diamond Max 60 GB - Model 96147U8 5400RPM. This drive adds roughly 77 hours of capacity. 
<P>
6.IBM Deskstar 75GB 7200 rpm drive. This drive adds roughly 96 hours of capacity.
<P>
Some caveats on choosing the right drive.
<P>
<PRE>
 Only Quantum drives work out of the box as A drives. If you wish to 
 use a non Quantum drive as the A drive see section 4.9 on how to do this. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 TiVos with locked drives initially won't boot with a Quantum as a B
 drive. The explanation for precisely why this is the case is long and
 boring, but there is a work-around.  See section 3.18 on how to do this.
</PRE>
<PRE>
 7200 RPM drives seem to work fine. They usually cost more than 5400 
 RPM drives, and will not give you any speed improvements by using 
 them. It should be noted that 7200 RPM drives will draw more power 
 and generate more heat than their 5400 counterparts. The long term 
 consequences of using 7200 RPM drives is still being debated. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 The Quantum LCT drives seem to run quieter than the other 
 drives also. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 Quantum has phased out the lct10 series.  They were superceded by
 the lct15 series, which is in turn in the process of being superceded
 by the lct20 series.  The lct15 and lct20 drives are 4400 RPM instead
 of 5400.  TiVo has shipped machines with all of these drives.
 Older machines had lct10's (and their predecessors), and new machines
 have lct20's.
</PRE>
<PRE>
 Note that newer drives tend to run quieter, consume less power, and
 produce less heat.  This may be important on the DirecTV/TiVo combo
 boxes, which run fairly hot even with the cooler drives (lct15 and
 later).
</PRE>
<PRE>
 The list of supported drives could go on and on. Basically any drive 
 20GB and up should work fine noting the above caveats.
</PRE>

slave on the CD/DVD bus. Mac's with SCSI cards have the first bus 
empty with the second holding the CD/DVD and zip drive. Its luck of

first bus.

5.When you restart the Macintosh, the new drive should not be seen on 
the desktop. You can verify that the drive is connected correctly by 
opening the program "Drive Setup" which came with your Macintosh. It 
should show you the drive, unformatted, as one of the choices to 
format. Do not format the drive with Drive Setup. 
<P>
6.Launch MacTivo Disk Blesser. Agree to the warning telling you that 
the author is not responsible for anything you do. 
<P>
7.Choose the drive you added and click on Format. 
<P>
8.The program will warn you about what you are going to do. Make sure 
you have the right drive connected and are specifying it correctly 
before answering yes. 
<P>
9.The program will give you feedback noting if the process was 
successful. If you run the program on a 30GB drive and MacTivo Disk 
Blesser reports it as a 9GB drive you have a problem. 
<P>
10.DO NOT insert a blessed drive into your TiVo that had the size 
reported wrong. If the size is wrong, the most likely issue is your 
using an older drive that does not support LBA mode. Every practical 
drive for upgrading a TiVo with (20GB and up) should all support 
LBA mode. 
<P>
11.If everything went fine you should be able to add the drive to 
your TiVo. Make sure the new drive is set as slave before placing 
it into your TiVo. 
<P>
12.Boot your TiVo. Go to your ``Messages and Setup'' screen and 
then the ``System Information'' section. You should see your 
Storage capacity in this screen. If you had a 14 hour TiVo and 
added a 30GB drive you should be at 52 hours and change. A 30 hour 
TiVo upgraded with a 30GB drive should give you about 68 hours and 
change. 
<P>
13.Do NOT remove this blessed drive once added to your TiVo. Once a 
blessed drive has been powered up and seen by a TiVo the two drives 
are married together. You can't remove a blessed drive and insert a 
new blessed drive once the first has been married. If you want to 
install a new blessed drive, or revert back to a single drive you 
will need to use your backup!

<H2><A NAME="3.7">3.7. How can I add a new drive to my TiVo with Dylan's bootdisk and the BlessTiVo program?</A></H2>
1.Download Dylan's boot disk at <A HREF="http://www.tivofaq.com/hack">http://www.tivofaq.com/hack</A>. 
<P>
2.Read the readme for Dylan's disk if you need more detail for any 
of the below items. 
<P>
3.Extract the files from the archive. Get a blank formatted floppy 
ready and run the batch file from the archive. It will prompt you to 
insert a floppy in drive a, and it will create the boot disk for you. 
<P>
4.Connect the new drive you wish to add to your PC. You can connect it 
to either the Primary Slave, Secondary Master, or Secondary Slave. I 
recommend using either of the above Slave settings. Regardless of 
which you pick you must set the appropriate jumper on your drive to 
reflect the master or slave setting. 
<P>
5.Make sure your PC BIOS auto-detects the drive and its size correctly. If your BIOS does not detect the drive correctly, try setting it to NONE for that drive. The BIOS does not always need to see the drive, and Linux doesn't generally care what the BIOS thinks anyway.
<P>
6.Boot the PC with the new drive connected and Dylan's floppy in the A 
drive. 
<P>
7.When the login prompt comes in type in ``root'' (no quotes) and hit 
enter. 
<P>
8.Type one of the following commands without the quotes depending on 
what port on your motherboard the drive is connected to. Case is 
important on the command. Only type ONE of the below commands. 
<P>
9.If the drive is connected as the Primary slave type 
``BlessTiVo /dev/hdb''. It should be noted that there is a space 
between the word BlessTiVo and the /dev/hdb in this example and the 
two below. 
<P>
10.If the drive is connected as the Secondary Master type 
``BlessTiVo /dev/hdc'' 
<P>
11.If the drive is connected as the Secondary Slave type 
``BlessTiVo /dev/hdd'' 
<P>
12.The program will warn you about what you are going to do. Make 
sure you have the right drive connected and are specifying the right 
port before answering yes. 
<P>
13.The program will give you feedback noting if the process was 
successful. It will report the size of your drive also. Make SURE 
this value is within about 2-3GB of your drives actual size. If 
you run the program on a 30GB drive and BlessTiVo reports it as a 
9GB drive you have a problem. 
<P>
14.DO NOT insert a blessed drive into your TiVo that had the size 
reported wrong. If the size is wrong, the most likely issue is your 
CMOS is not correct. See the documentation with Dylan's disk for 
more troubleshooting with the blessing process. 
<P>
15.If everything went fine you should be able to add the drive to 
your TiVo. Make sure the new B drive is set as slave before placing 
it into your TiVo. 
<P>
16.Boot your TiVo. Go to your ``Messages and Setup'' screen and then 
the ``System Information'' section. You should see your Storage 
capacity in this screen. If you had a 14 hour TiVo and added a 30GB 
drive you should be at 52 hours and change. A 30 hour TiVo upgraded 
with a 30GB drive should give you about 68 hours and change. 
<P>
17.Do NOT remove this blessed drive once added to your TiVo. Once a 
blessed drive has been powered up and seen by a TiVo the two drives 
are married together. You can't remove a blessed drive and insert a 
new blessed drive once the first has been married. If you want to 
install a new blessed drive, or revert back to a single drive you 
will need to use your backup!

<H2><A NAME="3.8">3.8. How can I add a second drive to my TiVo the true hackers way?</A></H2>
This information has been cut and pasted from the original hackers site <A HREF="http://tivohack.sourceforge.net">http://tivohack.sourceforge.net</A>. I apologize for editing this into steps, but it makes it easier for me to convert to and from
HTML. It should be noted that the comments about the 33.8GB barrier below are incorrect. 
<P>
1.Here's how to add a B drive to your TiVo by "blessing" it. This is approximately how we did it. We've only done it a few times so far. We will be refining the process. We simply wanted to get
the initial information out quickly. 
<P>
2.This has only been verified to work on a few units so far. A HDR112 has been upgraded to 52 hours with a 30 gig Quantum, another HDR112 has been upgraded to 40 hours with a 20 gig
Quantum, and a Sony 30 hour unit has been upgraded as well with a Maxtor B drive, although the newer Sony/Philips units have a drive locking mechanism that makes it very hard to mount
their A drives in a non-TiVo Linux box. 
<P>
3.WARNING: This modification is not "easy". You take all responsibility for modifying your TiVo in this way. It does involve opening the case and breaking the warranty sticker. Do not call
TiVo support if you make a mistake and break your TiVo. If you break it, you own both pieces. If you mess up, don't expect us to fix it for you either. Maybe some day someone will release a
utility that will just bless a drive in 1 easy command on your PC, but at this point, it's pretty tricky. It requires that you have various technical knowledge about Linux and other software tools.
You could easily render your TiVo inoperable and possibly unrecoverable. 
<P>
4.WARNING 2: There hasn't been a lot of testing so far on this procedure of course. Mine seems to be working perfectly at 52 hours, but you must accept the risk that something bad may
happen down the road. We suggest that you back up your original A drive in some fashion in case you make a mistake. How to do that we leave up to you. 
<P>
5.PDISK DISCLAIMER: We had to modify the source code to pdisk. Use it at your own risk. There may be bugs. We're not responsible for any loss of data. 
<P>
6.And PLEASE - be careful when you open the unit. It's power supply is unshielded. Stay away from it. 
<P>
7.In short - if you don't _understand_ what is going on below, don't do it. Just being able to read a list of steps may not be enough at this point. 
<P>
8.When I refer to hard drive partitions on the Linux box, I'll use hdX where X is whatever letter is appropriate for that drive. 
<P>
9.I used a Quantum lct10 30 gig drive (part number QML30000LB-A) that I bought from <A HREF="http://www.onsale.com">http://www.onsale.com</A>. My off the shelf Quantum seems to have the Quickview and TiVo extensions
in it, perhaps they all do. It is the same drive used in HDR31202's and presumably the newer Sony's. Any drive may work as a B drive, but I've only tried my Quantum. Also be aware - the
version of Linux on the TiVo doesn't seem to support drives larger than 33.8 gig. I don't know if TiVo patched their older kernel to support them. Set the B drives jumper to slave. 
<P>
10.You need to be able to access the original A drive and new B drive from another Linux box. To do this on an x86 box, you need to integrate TiVo's modifications to the Mac partition code.
There are some patches on <A HREF="http://tivohack.sourceforge.net">http://tivohack.sourceforge.net</A> and <A HREF="http://www.wasteland.org/tivo">http://www.wasteland.org/tivo</A>. Please, if anyone can mirror these few files it would be very helpful. If we get hit too
hard, we'll have to take the files down. You also need to be able to turn on byte swapping for those 2 drives (hdX=bswap). I had the most luck with Linux 2.4.0-test1. You also need to enable
the Mac partitioning in the kernel. 
<P>
11.If that all works, you'll see the TiVo's partitions on the A drive hooked to your Linux box. There should be 11 of them. Mount partition 4 (hdX4) somewhere, it's an ext2 filesystem. Edit the
bottom of etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit so it starts a bash shell on /dev/ttyS3. Also you need to blank out the first few sectors on the new B drive, with this command: "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdX bs=512
count=32". 
<P>
12.Get the hard drives back in the TiVo (both of em) and hook up the DSS serial cable to your computer. You'll need a null modem adapter and gender changer at the minimum. The terminal
settings are 9600,8N1. You should get a bash prompt shortly after the "please wait a few more seconds" screen. Run this command: "/sbin/bootpage -D /dev/hdb". Then shut down your TiVo
and hook the B drive back up to the Linux box. 
<P>
13.Now you need a modified version of pdisk which is available on the sites I mentioned above. Compile it if necessary (it's in RCS format). With the B drive in the Linux box, run "pdisk
/dev/hdX" and type in these commands (hit return after each character below): 
<P>
14.i 
<P>
15.w 
<P>
16.y 
<P>
17.q 
<P>
18.Then run: "pdisk -d /dev/hdX" and type these commands: 
<P>
19.C 2p 4M "Second MFS application region" MFS 
<P>
20.C 3p 3p "Second MFS media region" MFS 
<P>
21.x 
<P>
22.m 
<P>
23.3 
<P>
24.x 
<P>
25.w 
<P>
26.y 
<P>
27.q 
<P>
28.That will create the new partitions. Shut down the Linux box now and mount the B drive in the TiVo permanently. Turn the TiVo back on and get into the bash shell on it again. 
<P>
29.You need to mount the diagnostics partition next. Type this on your TiVo: "mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hda7 /mnt". Then run this to add the magic bit sequence to your new B drive:
"/mnt/diag/genAddDiskTiVoID /dev/hdb3". Type "umount /mnt" to unmount that diagnostics partition, and reboot your TiVo. That should do it. Check the system information and see if your
capacity increased. If not, you can try this one last thing that I don't believe is necessary, but it might be: mount the diagnostics partition again, and run "/mnt/diag/setkeys -globalkeys
/dev/hdb". 
<P>
30.That's it. If you want to now, you can edit the rc.sysinit to stop the bash shell from starting (or if you were smart, you made a backup copy when you started and can just copy the backup over
the modified one). 
<P>
31.Credit for figuring out this procedure goes to cc, Peter Creath, TivoTechie, and Ron Curry.

<H2><A NAME="3.9">3.9. Any other problems I might run into after adding the blessed drive?</A></H2>
If you notice skipping or pausing in your playback, you may need to 
switch the IDE cable that came with your TiVo with an ATA66 cable. 
The ATA66 cable has extra ground wires in it and can better protect 
the signals from noise. Most do not have this issue, but if you do the 
ATA66 cable seems to fix it. You can get these at most computer stores.

<H2><A NAME="3.10">3.10. How do I mount this darn drive in my TiVo?</A></H2>
Good question. I am sure there have been many creative ways to mount 
the new TiVo drive into the case, but the simplest seems to be 
getting some little ``rubber feet'' and sticking them to the bottom 
of the drive in all four corners. Then holding it down with some cable 
ties lengthwise along the unit (between the power and IDE connectors) 
to hold it sturdy. You could also make a mounting bracket, but the 
rubber feat and cable tie seems to be a nice cheap and safe approach.

It seems TiVo will be coming out with some new feature that will use 
up to 12 hours of storage for some unknown features at this time. TiVo 
has stated self upgraded units larger than 30 hours will lose up to 12 
hours for these new features. Nothing is specific at this time though. 
Worst case a 14 hour unit upgraded to 52 hours may become a 40 hour 
unit when this hits.

NO! Once you bless a drive and power up your TiVo with it, you can NOT 
take it out and replace it with another blessed drive. The only way 
to do this is to restore your A drive backup and start over.

If for some reason you need to remove your B drive from your TiVo the 
best option is to restore your A drive from your backup. Depending on 
how you did your backup you could restore partition 10 only and your 
TiVo should be back to a single drive unit again. If this doesn't 
work you can always do a full restore.

If your PC BIOS or BlessTiVo don't report the size of your drive correctly you have a few options. 
<P>
1.Go into your PC BIOS and change the drive in questions settings to 
NONE. Linux does not need the BIOS (but will use it sometimes). Some 
people have said they had to turn plug and play off in their BIOS too. 
I myself was able to bless a 60GB Maxtor drive on an old Pentium 166 
by setting its BIOS settings to none. The drive would lock up the 
computer if the BIOS on the PC was allowed to try detect it. 
<P>
2. If you have PC clone try the trick for the lock drive problem 
detailed in section 2.15
<P>
3.If the above doesn't work try checking your PC or motherboard 
manufacturers site for Flash BIOS updates for your motherboard. Be 
very careful when doing this and follow the directions to Flash your 
motherboard EXACTLY 
<P>
4.Try a different computer (friends, work, etc).

This problem has been seen mostly on the initial Sony TiVos.  It manifests itself on machines with locked drives.  It would seem that machines shipping with TiVo software 2.0 do not have this problem.
<P>
To get around this problem, you need to turn off the TiVo's automatic disk-locking feature.  Enter the diagnostic mode (see section 4.3).  In that menu,
<P>
<PRE>
 5 - Toggle auto disk locking
</PRE>
<PRE>
 8 - Save changes to configuration
</PRE>
Saving the changes takes a few seconds, so be sure to wait for the prompt to return.  Then reboot your TiVo.
<P>
Your TiVo should now boot happily with the Quantum B drive.

<H2><A NAME="4.1">4.1. Converting your TiVo for PAL input</A></H2>
The current models of TiVo only handle NTSC. While TiVo is planning
a release of a model in the UK that does PAL, those of us who live
in PAL countries (like Australia) might want to get my "palkit"
PAL patch from <A HREF="http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge">http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge</A>/
<P>
This patch works by modifying the registers on the SAA7114 and CXD1922
to select PAL input. Only input is affected. I am working on another
patch for PAL output and will release it when its done. Luckily
most modern TVs do both NTSC and PAL input.
<P>
UPDATE: I now have PAL output working as well. Run the program
"setpal" from my download area above
<P>
UPDATE2 (October 10th): I've released a new version of palkit (version
1.2). This version uses a much simpler method and does good quality
PAL on both input and output. More recently I've also fixed a problem
with running at other than best quality.
<P>
(NOTE: currently palmode will NOT work with 2.0.x of the TiVo software,
Tridge is aware of this and looking into it att.)

<H2><A NAME="4.3">4.3. How can I access the secret TiVo diagnostic mode?</A></H2>
Upon power up if the TiVo receives a return key within a second or two it will ask the user for a secret password to get into a diagnostic mode (also known as the ``ROM Monitor'').  This diagnostic mode is no longer available on the DirecTV/TiVo combo boxes.
<P>
The following are the steps to access this mode. 
<P>
1.Connect your DSS port on the back of the TiVo to your PC's serial port. 
Your TiVo should have came with a connector that plugs into the DSS 
Serial port on the back of the TiVo and has a 9 pin D-Type connector 
on the other end. You will need to put a ``null modem'' adaptor on 
the 9pin and also a gender changer to be able to use it with your PC. 
You can buy these at most computer stores, or Radio Shack. 
<P>
2.Run your favorite terminal program on Linux or Windows. Minicom 
works great and is with most Linux distributions, Hyperterminal with 
Windows works fine also. 
<P>
3.Connect the serial cable between the TiVo and the PC uses the above 
mentioned cables and adaptors. 
<P>
4.Set your terminal program to 9600, N81 with no flow control 
(hardware or software). Also make sure the COM port your using in the 
terminal program matches the COM port the PC is plugged into. 
<P>
5.Power up the TiVo and immediately hit enter in your terminal program 
``once''. The timing on this is a tad tricky.  The best rule of thumb 
is to hit enter once you see the little TiVo guy picture pop up.
<P>
6.The TiVo will prompt you with a ``Verify: '' prompt. The password is 
``factory'' (no quotes). The password was discovered by sorphin. This 
password seems to work with some units. If your unit doesn't take the 
factory password see section 4.8 on how to change the password.
<P>
<P>
(NOTE: currently it is not possible to get to the prom prompt/into the
prom (aka "diagnostic mode") with newer tivos (including DTivos),
a prom version of 1.88 or higher.)

<H2><A NAME="4.4">4.4. Getting a BASH prompt on your TiVo with the Diagnostic Mode</A></H2>
This procedure is for 1.3 or previous units only. This will NOT work in 2.0, as the "shondss" variable has been removed.
<P>
1.Follow the steps needed to get into the diagnostic screen. 
<P>
2.From the diagnostic menu type ``X'' to see the extended menu. 
<P>
3.Use option ``P'' to change the boot parameters. 
<P>
4.The system will display your current boot parameters. You will want 
to append the string ``shondss=true'' to the current boot parameters. 
Also if you have added any other parameters you should append them also. 
<P>
5.For example. If you current parameters are ``root=/dev/hda7'' you 
will change the parameters to ``root=/dev/hda7 shondss=true''. It is 
very important to maintain whatever the current boot parameters in 
your unit are. The boot parameters can vary from unit to unit. 
<P>
6.Type ``B'' to continue booting. 
<P>
7.Remember to remove the ``shondss=true'' if you need the DSS serial 
port for control of your DSS receiver. If you use the IR port for 
control you can leave the BASH mode active. Your TiVo will still function.

<H2><A NAME="4.6">4.6. Getting a BASH prompt with Dylan's bootdisk</A></H2>
"Bash" is a command shell (the "Borne Again SHell"); you enter command 
file names and arguments, it executes those commands -- much like running
"command.com" in DOS.  A TiVo doesn't have a console, so we have
to create a command shell on the available serial port.
<P>
To do this, we have to modify the TiVo disk from a regular PC where we 
can already get a command shell.
<P>
If you use Dylan's bootdisk or a Linux system (compiled with the TiVo
partition support), you can mount the partition containing your current
kernel on your TiVo "A" drive, then edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit file to
get a bash prompt on the TiVo's DSS serial port.
<P>
1.Connect your TiVo "A" drive to your PC. Either boot Dylan's boot disk
or your modified Linux kernel that supports TiVo's special partitions.
<P>
Special Note: If using Dylan's bootdisk remember that you CAN'T 
connect a TiVo disk drive setup as "master" on the primary IDE bus, it 
will not mount.  While booting Dylan's bootdisk, just before 
displaying the "login:" prompt, the console should display all the 
Tivo partitions on the disk.  If they are not displayed (and you can't 
mount the disk), then the TiVo disk was probably put on the primary 
IDE bus as a master.  Note that the TiVo disk drive is jumpered to 
master by default.  You can cable the drive on the secondary IDE bus, 
OR, (for the standard Quantum drive -- see instructions on the disk 
for other drives) move the jumper from the first to the third pair of 
pins in order to make the disk a "slave" rather than a "master" on the 
primary IDE bus.  If jumpered as master on the primary IDE bus, you'll 
get the following errors trying to mount the drive:
<P>
<PRE>
	/dev/hda4: Success
	FAT bread failed
	FAT bread failed
	mount: you must specify the filesystem type
</PRE>
Special Note #2: When connecting cables to a disk drive, it's usually not a problem to put the IDE cable in backwards (it won't boot/mount but it usually doesn't hurt anything), unless it's keyed, in which case, improper mounting can break off a pin:
<P>
<PRE>
	<A HREF="http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/004264.html">http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/004264.html</A>
</PRE>
The 1 pin is on the red striped edge of the cable.
<P>
The rule of thumb is: the 1 pin is next to the power connector on the disk (but not always).  You can also look for a "1" on the circuit board by the connector on the disk.  Also, the connector might be keyed: a hump on the outside of the cable connector should match the divot on the disk side of the connection.  The cable might also have one pin-hole filled in: this should match the missing pin on the disk side of the connector.
<P>
All power connectors are keyed: while they require extreme force to remove, they should be simple to insert.  If you're trying to use excessive force to connect the power connector, then you're probably putting it in backwards.  If it's backwards, you'll fry the disk controller.
<P>
2.Your TiVo disk drive has many partitions. Two have bootable
kernels stored on them, and can be mounted as the root partition 
("root" is the main partition, 
like the DOS "C:" partition).  They can't be mounted as root at the 
same time -- one is backup should the other fail, and the dormant partition gets upgrades when available. 
So all changes that you make to one root partition, you should mirror (copy) 
on the other.  Both root partitions contain an rc.sysinit file,
much like a DOS "autoexec.bat" file that is executed at boot time. 
This file must be modified to get the "bash" command shell prompt on the 
serial port. You should edit both files on both partitions. 
<P>
If you'd rather just edit the file on one partition, then you can determine
which partition will boot as root by examining the 2nd byte on the first
sector of the TiVo "A" drive. If the value is a 3 then edit your
/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit file on partition 4, if it is a 6 the file is
on partition 7.  But, we're not going to tell you how ;)
<P>
3.Enter the following to mount partition 4:
<P>
<PRE>
	mount /dev/hdX4 /mnt
</PRE>
Where X is the letter
representing the IDE port where the TiVo "A" drive is connected on 
your motherboard:
<P>
<PRE>
        X = "b" (/dev/hdb4) -- if disk is setup as slave on primary IDE bus
</PRE>
<PRE>
        X = "c" (/dev/hdc4) -- if disk is setup as master on secondary IDE bus.
</PRE>
<PRE>
        X = "d" (/dev/hdd4) -- if disk is setup as slave on secondary IDE bus.
</PRE>
(Note that X will never be "a", master on the primary IDE bus.)
<P>
If the disk won't mount, maybe you're having a problem with a locked disk,  See section 2.15 for information on how to unlock the disk.
<P>
4.Type ``joe /mnt/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit'' (without the quotes).
<P>
4 (alternate). Instead of using an editor, you can type:
<P>
<PRE>
        echo '/bin/bash &lt;/dev/ttyS3 &gt;&amp; /dev/ttyS3 &amp;' &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
</PRE>
(that's all one line, use the quotes, don't forget the ">>" -- using a 
single "&gt;" instead will destroy/replace the entire file with the one line)
<P>
If you use the "echo" rather than "joe", then, skip to step 8.
<P>
5.Go to the bottom of the file and add the following on a line all by
itself.
<P>
6.``/bin/bash &lt;/dev/ttyS3 &gt;&amp; /dev/ttyS3 &amp; '' (without the quotes)
<P>
7.Save the changes. (CTRL-K CTRL-X)
<P>
8.If you have any other files you wish to put or edit on the TiVo 
(rather than using zmodem over the serial line), you can do it now 
(put those files on an alternate floppy, mount the floppy with "mkdir 
/foo; mount /dev/fd0 /foo", then copy the files with "cp 
/foo/&lt;whatever&gt; /mnt/&lt;whatever&gt;").
<P>
9.Type ``umount /mnt'' (without the quotes).
<P>
10.Repeat steps 3-9 to edit partition 7.  In step 3, use "/dev/hdX7" rather
than "/dev/hdX4".
<P>
10 (alternate). Mount partition 7 on another mountpoint, and copy
the files from partition 4 to partition 7.  This should only be done if the TiVo partitions are the same version.  First, remount partition 
4, since we unmounted in step 9:
<P>
<PRE>
	mount /dev/hdX4 /mnt
</PRE>
Then, make another directory, and mount the other disk there:
<P>
<PRE>
	mkdir /mnt7
	mount /dev/hdX7 /mnt7
</PRE>
Then, check the versions of the two partitions:
<P>
<PRE>
	cat /mnt/etc/build-version /mnt7/etc/build-version
</PRE>
If the versions are the same, then, copy your rc.sysinit file from one partition to the other (otherwise, modify rc.sysinit with "echo" or "joe" as detailed in section 4.6):
<P>
<PRE>
	cp /mnt/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit /mnt7/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit 
</PRE>
If you have any other files modified under /mnt, copy those changes too.  
Make sure to unmount your partitions:
<P>
<PRE>
	umount /mnt /mnt7
</PRE>
11.After powering down the PC, remove the TiVo disk and install it 
back in the TiVo.  If you moved the disk's jumper from the "master" to 
the "slave" position in step #1, make sure to return the jumper to the 
"master" position.
<P>
12.Connect your DSS (serial) port on the back of the TiVo to your PC's serial
port. Your TiVo should have included a connector that plugs into the
DSS Serial port on the back of the TiVo and has a 9 pin D-Type
connector on the other end. You will need to put a ``null modem''
adaptor on the 9pin and also a gender changer to be able to use it
with your PC. You can buy these at most computer stores, or Radio Shack.
<P>
13.Run your favorite terminal program on Linux or Windows. Minicom
works great and is with most Linux distributions, Hyperterminal with
Windows works fine also.
<P>
14.Connect the serial cable between the TiVo and the PC uses the above
mentioned cables and adaptors.
<P>
15.Set your terminal program to 9600, N81 with no flow control
(hardware or software). Also make sure the COM port your using in the
terminal program matches the COM port the PC is plugged into.
<P>
16.Turn on your TiVo. After the ``please wait a few more seconds
message'' is displayed on the TV, you should get a shell prompt on your
terminal program.
<P>
17.If you do not then check your COM port settings and cables. If you
only edited one rc.sysinit script you may have gotten the wrong one.
<P>
18.If it works you can now explore your TiVo while its running and do
all kinds of dangerous things!
<P>
19.If pressing the "enter" key causes the next "bash" prompt to be displayed
immediately below the cursor on the next line, rather than the first column of the
next line, then enter:
<P>
<PRE>
	stty sane
</PRE>
And your prompt should behave normally when pressing "enter"

There is a environmental variable you can set called ``runideturbo''. 
This variable needs to be set to false. You can do this a couple ways. 
Both will be described below. Setting this variable allows non Quantum

<H2><A NAME="4.10">4.10. Configuring for a non Quantum drive with Dylan's boot disk.</A></H2>
The first way to do this is to connect your newly made non Quantum A 
drive to your PC ( do not connect as the Primary master or you will 
not be able to mount the drive). And do the following. 
<P>
1.Boot the PC with Dylan's bootdisk 
<P>
2.At the login prompt type ``root'' and hit enter. 
<P>
3.Type the following followed by the enter key. ``mount /dev/hdX4 /mnt'' where the X is the either b c or d depending 
on if you connected the non Quantum A drive to your PC's primary slave, 
secondary master or secondary slave respectively. 
<P>
4.Type the following. ``cd /mnt/etc/rc.d'' and hit enter 
<P>
5.Then type ``joe rc.sysinit'' and hit enter 
<P>
6.This will place you in a text editor. Add the following as the 
second non-commented line in the file. ``runideturbo=false'' (no "#" in front of it)
<P>
7.Hold the CTRL key down and hit the K key. Then release the CTRL key 
and hit the X key. Save your changes.
<P>
8.Type ``cd /'' and hit enter. 
<P>
9.Type ``umount /mnt'' and hit enter. 
<P>
10.Repeat steps 3 - 9 except use the command ``mount /dev/hdX7 /mnt'' 
instead in step 3. This is so both Linux partitions on the TiVo are 
modified. If you know which is the active kernel partition you can 
just modify that one, if not do both just to be safe. 
<P>
11.After finished step 9 the second time through you can power down 
the PC and use the non Quantum drive in your TiVo.

<H2><A NAME="4.12">4.12. What other cool variables can I set in the TiVo and what do they do?</A></H2>
All the below variables below can be setup either from the diagnostic 
menu of the TiVo or using Dylan's bootdisk as noted above in the 
section on using non Quantum drives as the A drive in your TiVo. 
Variables will be detailed below and their effect. The quotes 
surrounding the variables should be ommited when placing them in the 
boot parameters or in the /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit file. NOTE.  When placing 
these variables in the rc.sysinit file you should put the word "export" in 
front of them.  For example "MYWORLD_ENABLE_BACKDOORS=1" would look like 
"export MYWORLD_ENABLE_BACKDOORS=1".  Do this for any of the variables in this section. 
You do NOT need to do this if you are placing them in the boot sector, 
and can use them as is shown beloe.
<P>
"MYWORLD_ENABLE_BACKDOORS=1" (not in 2.0)
<P>
This allows you to access some hidden features of the TiVo. If this 
variable is set the TiVo should say ``Backdoors Enabled'' in the system 
information screen. When this mode is active the following TiVo remote 
key sequences will access special features. See section 4.25 for all the details.
<P>
Adding this will also have your TiVo show more information in the System Information screen. The TiVo will show how long it has been up since the last power cycle (uptime).
<P>
"LIVE_CACHE_SIZE=20700" (not in 2.0)
<P>
Adding this changes your live TV buffer from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. 
If you set it to 10350 that will give you the normal 30 minute buffer. 
So increase it by 10350 for however many 30 minute you want to add to 
the live buffer. A few things should be noted about this hack. 
<P>
<PRE>
  Don't try creating a buffer larger than your free space. So if you 
  have a 30 hour unit and you have 29 hours of shows recorded, do not 
  try to increase your live TV buffer to 4 hours (82800). 
</PRE>
<PRE>
  The TiVo ``green bar'' indicator still thinks the live TV buffer is 
  30 minutes, but it will still work with your new settings.
</PRE>
"TIVO_CORRECTION_OFFSET=2000" (not in 1.3)
<P>
This appears to be the value used to back up after play is hit while fast forwarding or rewinding (auto known as the autocorrection).. It's in milliseconds. 2000 is the default.
<P>
"TIVO_CORRECTION_DELAY=1000" (not in 1.3)
<P>
This appears to be a variable to define how much time it takes for the IR command to be processed. 1000 appears to be very close to the default value, although the exact default value is unknown.
<P>
As posted by Otto in <A HREF="http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/003579.html">http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/003579.html</A> :
<P>
<PRE>
  I like 1000,750 (offset,delay) better... I tried setting offset 
  to zero and found that it was a bit harder to gauge it at different 
  speed settings. So I upped it back to 1 second and lowered the delay 
  from 900 to 750 and now it nails it right on the money. 
</PRE>
It's recommended that you try various settings for these two values until you find what works for you.
<P>
Also, sometimes the values may not seem to have any effect. As posted by Otto: 
<P>
<PRE>
  Try playing a recorded show and pausing and doing a frame advance. I
  think this causes it to reload some parameters.
</PRE>
That should cause it to take effect if you are having problems adjusting the settings.

<H2><A NAME="4.13">4.13. I set all those cool variables above, and for no reason they stopped working. Help!</A></H2>
More than likely your TiVo just upgraded its software from 1.2.1 to 1.3 
(or possibly 2.0 when it is released). You probably added the variables 
to the rc.sysinit file. When TiVo upgrades their software they format 
and install the new software onto the other inactive Linux partition. 
So any changes you made to your rc.sysinit file will be lost. You will 
need to redo them. People who set the ``runideturbo'' variable to true 
to use a non Quantum drive as an A drive will have to reset this 
variable before they can even boot their TiVo after an upgrade. It is 
advisable to use the diagnostic mode to set these variables since they 
have not been modified in a software upgrade (yet).

 osdwriter:    By executing this program and passing it the filename of 
               a cs22 file on your TiVo you can force the TiVo to display 
               that static image on the screen. You can hit your TiVo

<H2><A NAME="4.23">4.23. Running LinuxPPC binaries on your TiVo</A></H2>
yes, you can run LinuxPPC binaries on your TiVo. This provides an
easy way to get lots of software going quickly. 
<P>
BUT, the ld.so and libc.so that comes with the TiVo are incompatible
with LinuxPPC binaries. You need to put copies of the LinuxPPC ones
in /lib but not overwrite the ones that are already there. This
is possible because you can give them different names. For libc this
is easy as LinuxPPC binaries look for libc.so.6 instead of libc.so
but for ld.so you need to edit the LinuxPPC binaries to look for the 
right dynamic loader.  I chose to call the LinuxPPC loader ld.so.X
and edited my LinuxPPC binaries to change the "1" in ld.so.1 to a "X"
I've put copies of the ld.so.X and libc.so.6 files I used
in my download area at <A HREF="http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge">http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge</A>/.

<H2><A NAME="4.25">4.25. What are Backdoor codes and how do I use them?</A></H2>
Backdoor codes allow access to some hidden features of the TiVo.  They seem to be gone from TiVo software version 2.0.
<P>
To access them, you first need to enable backdoor codes.  There are several ways to do this.  First, you can set the MYWORLD_ENABLE_BACKDOORS variable (see section 4.12).
<P>
Alternatively, under version 1.3 of the TiVo software (and reportedly on version 1.5), you can enable the backdoors using the remote.  "Browse By Name" for "0v1t" (TiVo spelled backwards with zero and one instead of "O" and "I") and press the "Thumbs-Up" key.  You should see a message stating "Backdoors enabled!"
<P>
In either case, if you go to the "System Information" screen, you should see "Backdoors Enabled".
<P>
When Backdoor mode is active the following TiVo remote key sequences will access special features:
<P>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Enter Clear Thumbs-Up'' will allow you to access the TiVo's 
   log files on your TV screen. Page up and page down allow you to move 
   through the log information and the right arrow you to move through 
   the log files. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Enter Clear Thumbs-Down'' will shut down the myworld program 
   on a TiVo. The myworld program is the brains of the TiVo. Shutting 
   it down is not advisable since the only thing you can do with the 
   TiVo at that point is use the BASH shell if you activated one. If 
   you do have a BASH prompt you can rerun the myworld program to get 
   the TiVo running fully again. If not you need to power down and up 
   the TiVo to get it fully functional again. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Enter Clear 4'' this forces suggestions to be rebuilt. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Enter Clear FastForward'' this resets the TiVo 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Enter Clear 5'' toggles the overshoot correction during fast 
   forwarding on and off. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Enter Clear Skip-to-end'' turns on "Boat-Anchor" mode. This
   convinces the TiVo that it should behave as if it has no guide
   data(?).  It's unknown whether this requires backdoor mode to
   be enabled, and it's not a good idea to try it.
</PRE>
<P>
The following codes must be entered in the "Browse By Name" screen. 
<P>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter 1'' gives you Speed1: prompt. Turns the record LED on
   (indicating the backdoor is open and can be changed?). Enter a
   number for how fast you want the first scan speed to run at, then
   press  ``Enter Enter 1 again. The record LED will go out. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
   The last two digits of the number must be 00 for an integer multiple
   speed. The digits to the left of the 00 indicate how many times
   normal playing speed the scan is running. 300 (which is 3x) is the
   default Speed1 scan speed, but you can't see that, you can only
   enter a number. A value of "1" is super slow motion (.01x speed)
   Unit will revert back to default speed when rebooted. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter 2'' gives you Speed2: prompt. Default is 2000. See
   Speed1 above. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter 3'' gives you Speed3: prompt. Default is 6000. See
   Speed1 above. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter 4'' gives you Rate1: prompt. Function unknown. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter 5'' gives you Rate2: prompt. Function unknown. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter 6'' gives you Rate3: prompt. Function unknown. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter 7'' gives you Inter: prompt. Function unknown. (Same
   as TIVO_INTERSTITIAL_INTERVAL environment variable.) 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter 8'' gives you Open: prompt. Function unknown. (Same
   as TIVO_LONGOPEN_INTERVAL environment variable.) 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter 9'' gives you Int.disabled, or int.enabled prompt.
   Toggles "interstitials". Intersititials were little TiVo guy
   animations that occurred between each menu screen. Most of them
   were deleted as being too annoying, but the initial boot one
   remains. Setting the TIVO_DISABLE_INTERSTITIALS environment
   variable to 1 disables it. Toggling "Int." from the remote causes
   the animation to play every time you hit the TiVo button. This may
   not work on Sony machines.
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Enter Enter Tivo'' If in Debug mode (see C-C-E-E 2 below), lets you
   set the TiVo's clock. Warning: setting this value is very tricky (and
   hasn't really been worked out yet), and may cause all of your Guide
   data to get "expired". If you want to play with this, keep in mind
   that TiVo may get mad at you for downloading several copies of your
   Guide data over the course of a couple of days. The best way to fix a
   messed up clock without reloading all the Guide data is to do the
   "Make a Test Call" option. 
</PRE>
The following codes must be entered in the "System Information" screen. 
<P>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 1'' goes Nowhere, Does Nothing; included for
   completeness. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 2'' turns on "Special Mode: DEBUG" (Note:
   you have to leave the "System Information" screen and re-enter it to
   see this flag turned on.) Starts sending debugging output to the
   /var/log/tvdebuglog file. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 3'' seems to initiate a call. (a special one?) 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 4'' makes the machine go "Bing!" 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 5'' and you have the machine that goes "Bing!" 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 6'' will reveal the machine that goes "Bing!" 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 7'' causes a message to be written to
   /var/log/tven saying: SetupDebugContext::OnNumber[94]: USER PROBLEM
   LOGSTAMP 
</PRE>
<PRE>
   This works even without Backdoors enabled.  It's likely that Customer
   Support tells customers who are having problems to do CCEE7 around
   the time that the problem occurs, and then when they upload the logs,
   they can help locate what was going on when the problem happened. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 8'' takes you to the "Channels You Watch"
   page with NONE OF THE CHANNELS SELECTED! I guess this would be a
   quick way to clear your channel list. Fortunately you can just back
   out of it without losing your current channel list. Nobody has tried
   going forward from that screen... 
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 9'' I see you have the machine that goes
   "Bing!"
</PRE>
<PRE>
 ``Clear Clear Enter Enter 0'' allows you to enter your own "Dial-in
   configuration code"! It does not appear to let you directly change
   the TFA value. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
  Otto reports at <A HREF="http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/002736.html">http://www.avsforum.com/ubbtivo/Forum6/HTML/002736.html</A>: 
</PRE>

     TFA is definitely Toll Free Authorization. We wormed it out of one
     of the Tivo CS guys. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
     0=[Access] denied ["you probably didn't ask, but you used a local, so QED"]
     1=No decision [made yet] (you got time)
     2=Oh you requested (we'll get back to ya)
     3=Yeah, I guess so
     4=Researched and you are out of luck
     5=You had your chance but did nothing 
</PRE>
<PRE>
     The Dial In Access code (the 000 part) can be changed via some
     special key sequences.... Anyway, when Tivo CS gets a really
     unusual problem that needs files downloaded to the unit, they can
     tell the customer to change the access code and it'll then download
     certain types of files.. These may be predefined debugging type
     things or may be files the guy just then put on the server. 
</PRE>
<PRE>
     So I won't tell you how to change that number. Best case scenario:
     Your daily call fails. Worst case scenario: Your Tivo breaks by
     downloading and running some weird debug thing and is unrepairable
     without a whole drive backup.
</PRE>
The list of codes is in no way exhaustive, as until recently it was not easy to enter "Backdoors enabled" mode.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="4.26">4.26. TiVo Ethernet howto</A></H2>
The TiVoNet adapter creates an ISA bus on the TiVo using the factory 
test connector (that looks like a PCI edge connector) on the front of 
the TiVo motherboard.  It's important to note that the TiVo does not 
include provisions for either a PCI or ISA bus, and this ISA bus add-on 
is not fully ISA compliant, but it does allow for NE2000 compatible and 
3COM 3C503 NIC cards that don't require DMA.
<P>
Andrew Tridgell was instrumental in developing this board.  He's well 
respected in the Linux community for developing "Samba" (by ethernet 
packet sniffing, he reverse engineered the Microsoft proprietary SMB 
networking protocol used to share files between Windows boxes; so 
Linux machines can act as Windows file servers and clients).

For further redundancy, read on...
<P>
NOTE: The moment you take off the cover of the TiVo unit, your 
warantee is void.
<P>
NOTE: This FAQ entry is intended to be the simplest method to get your TiVoNet up and running (for example, if all goes well, you'll never need serial port shell access).  Only use the following instructions when using a professionally 
built and tested TiVoNet system with an included NE2000 compatible card (i.e. the 9thTee package).  Many 
testing steps are skipped that you should perform if building your own 
card or integrating the TiVoNet with an untested NIC card;  the FAQ URL's listed above are better resources in these cases.  There is a 
script (etc...) available from 9thTee that follows these instructions
somewhat automatically (the script can be customized from Windows).  
Note that this is still beta:
<P>
<PRE>
	<A HREF="http://9thtee.com/tivonetfloppy.zip">http://9thtee.com/tivonetfloppy.zip</A>
</PRE>
This script is intended for those who haven't already upgraded their TiVo.  If you've already hacked your TiVo, then the script may screw up what you've already done.  The script has been sucessfully used on TiVo v1.3 and v2.0.1 systems.
<P>
NOTE: do remember to plug the TiVoNet internal floppy-style power adapter in correctly -- 
if you plug it in backwards, you could apply 12v where 5v is expected
and fry your TiVoNet board.
The power connector on the board has "red" and "black" printed on the
board next to the posts that connect to the red and black power/ground 
wires. When properly powered, the TiVoNet board's LED should lite up 
(and not the capacitors ;).  If you have a two-wire connector, then you should
not have to worry about this problem (just don't cross power and ground,
make sure all four posts are connected to the floppy-style power connector).
<P>
NOTE: when assembling the TiVoNet on your TiVo, put the NIC together 
with the TiVoNet first (holding each board in one hand), then put the 
combined unit on the TiVo motherboard.  Make sure both ISA and PCI connectors are 
firmly seated.  When seating the PCI connector, you need to place your fingers on the back of the TiVoNet board, where the pins of the PCI connector stick out, then press towards the TiVo motherboard to seat.  The pins sticking in your fingers can hurt a bit: use an eraser (not from the end of a pencil, but a long, flat, stand-alone one) between your finger and the pins.
<P>
NOTE: the TiVo's internal power supply is unprotected.  It's adjacent to where
the main (120v) power plug connects to the box. It'll give you a good jolt
even if the TiVo's power cord is unplugged.  Keep your (and your kids)
distance from this
part of the unit.
<P>
NOTE: to protect the components from static shock, make sure to properly ground yourself when dealing with the 
TiVoNet board, the NIC adapter, or the TiVo motherboard.  I find it sufficient 
to touch an exposed (unpainted) part of the chassis of another computer that's 
plugged in (grounded), before touching components.
Radio Shack sells a wrist strap to keep you constantly 
grounded.
<P>
--End of important notes.
<P>
Assuming the complete TiVoNet installed: the NIC drivers must be loaded, 
the interface and route configured, and the telnet daemon must be 
started.
<P>
The best way to do this, if you're starting with an unhacked TiVo 
(no bash prompt on the serial port), is to follow the instructions for 
"Getting a BASH prompt" in section 4.6 of this HAQ FAQ, with the 
following exceptions and additions...
<P>
1. Create another floppy disk with the files "8390.0", "tivone.o", and 
"probe.o" from:
<P>
<PRE>
	<A HREF="http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge">http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge</A>/
</PRE>
You might also want to load this floppy with "nfs.o" (the NFS kernel 
module, for mounting directories from other Unix systems), "smbfs.o" 
(The Samba file system kernel module) and "smbmount" (for mounting 
Windows "shares" onto the tivo), an ftp daemon, or "rsync".  Most of 
those are available at the 9thtee site:
<P>
<PRE>
	<A HREF="http://www.9thtee.com/tivonetusage.htm">http://www.9thtee.com/tivonetusage.htm</A>
</PRE>
except "rsync", which is available from Tridge's site:
<P>
<PRE>
	<A HREF="http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge">http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge</A>/
</PRE>
2. Section 4.6, step 8, refers to "additional files from a floppy".  
With the TiVo "A" disk mounted, create a mount point and mount the 
floppy (make sure the floppy is in the drive):
<P>
<PRE>
	mkdir /floppy
	mount /dev/fd0 /floppy
</PRE>
3. Copy the kernel modules from the floppy to the "A" drive.
<P>
<PRE>
	cp /mnt/floppy/8390.o /mnt/lib/modules
	cp /mnt/floppy/tivone.o /mnt/lib/modules
	cp /mnt/floppy/probe.o /mnt/lib/modules
</PRE>
Make sure to follow the section 4.6 instructions, assuring that both 
root partitions 4 and 7 get the same files.
<P>
4. Rename the route command (it screws up PPP if the TiVoNet is running) and leave a route command that does nothing in it's place:
<P>
<PRE>
	cp /mnt/sbin/route /mnt/sbin/route.tivo
	echo '#!/bin/bash' &gt;/mnt/sbin/route
</PRE>
Repeat this for both partitions 4 and 7.
<P>
4. Alternate. Modify tcphonehome.tcl script.
<P>
Look for the line where it is trying to add the default route:
<P>
<PRE>
	$gw=/bin/getprom -gateway
 	route add default gw $gw
</PRE>
Replace $gw in the second line with the correct IP address.
<P>
4. Alternate 2.  modify "gw" from the boot prom (see how to modify boot prom parameters elsewhere in this FAQ).
<P>
5. Section 4.6, steps 4-7, refer to modifying the /mnt/etc/rc.sysinit 
file.  In addition,  at the end of the file, add the commands to load 
the drivers and configure the interface and start up the telnet daemon:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
	if [ "$tivoether" = true ]; then
            (
             tnlited 23 /bin/bash -login &amp;
             sync ;
             insmod -f /lib/modules/8390.o ;
             insmod -f /lib/modules/tivone.o ;
             sleep 2;
             sync;
             ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.72 up ;
             route.tivo add default gw 192.168.1.1 ;
            ) &amp;
         fi
</PRE>
Where "192.168.1.72" is the ethernet address you want for your TiVo, 
and "192.168.1.1" is your gateway (replace those values with your 
desired values appropriate for your network).
<P>
"tivoether" is a boot prom parameter.  Setting these parameters is 
covered in the HACK FAQ in sections 4.3 and 4.8.  This allows you to 
turn on and off booting with the TiVoNet from the prom monitor.
<P>
If you're feeling lucky, then just set "tivoether" to true before the 
predicate, i.e.:
<P>
<PRE>
	export tivoether=true
</PRE>
(put this before the predicate in rc.sysinit, shown at the top of this 
step 5.)
<P>
If the ethernet board (or just mis-coded driver) hangs your TiVo, then
having tivoether in the boot parameters is a quick way to revive your
system.  If you set it to "true" in rc.sysinit, and it hangs the TiVo,
then you'll have to reboot the TiVo without the TiVoNet hardware to 
revive the system (assuming bad hardware caused the hang).  If that 
still hangs the system, then the above predicate hung the system, and 
you'll have to remove the drive, reboot with Dylan's boot disk, and 
remove this predicate from the rc.sysinit (using the "joe" editor).
<P>
Note that, if you halt the system with the root partition mounted R/W, 
then the system will delay for a long period of time during booting 
while checking the root partition. This is just a delay, not a hang.
<P>
Rather than hand editing this predicate into rc.sysinit using "joe", 
you can create a file on your floppy that contains this predicate, and 
append this file to the end of rc.sysinit after booting Dylan's boot 
disk.  For example, let's say you called the file containing this 
script "tivostartup.txt" and put it on the secondary floppy (mounted 
in step 2):
<P>
<PRE>
	cat /mnt/floppy/tivostartup.txt &gt;&gt;/mnt/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
</PRE>
Will append the contents of this file to the end of rc.sysinit.
<P>
If you create this text file from a Windows machine, make sure to run the file thru a "dos2unix.exe" utility to replace CR/LF's appropriately.
<P>
If you chose to modify "tcphonehome.tcl" in step "4 alternate" or set the gateway address up from the prom monitor in step "4 alternate 2", then make sure to use the normal "route" command, rather than "route.tivo" in the modified rc.sysinit script.
<P>
Make sure, as detailed in section 4.6, to modify the rc.sysinit 
on both partitions 4 and 7.
<P>
6.  Copy any other files you want on your TiVo system (see examples 
above), and modify rc.sysinit accordingly, if necessary.
<P>
7.  Make sure to unmount the TiVo parititions before turning the PC 
power off (as described in section 4.6) and replacing any changed jumper
on the hard disk.
<P>
8.  After starting the TiVo with it's modified disk and the network 
card cabled correctly, you should be able to telnet directly to the IP 
address you configured for your TiVo -- bypassing using the serial port 
BASH prompt altogether (unless you need to set the "tivoether" boot 
parameter -- in which case you'll need to use the serial port to access 
the prom monitor, then set this parameter).
<P>
If you telnet in sucessfully, your set!
<P>
If not, then continue to the debugging section:
<P>
DEBUGGING:
<P>
1. If you changed jumper settings to boot your TiVo disk in a PC, did you change the 
jumper settings back the way they were before reinstalling the disk in the
TiVo?
<P>
2. Start by logging in via the serial console, as described in section 4.6 
of this FAQ.  If you can't log in, then rc.sysinit was possibly not 
correctly modified or the NIC card drivers are hanging the system.
<P>
(Note: step 5, above, gives some detailed examples for debugging this problem,
depending on how you setup the "tivoether" variable.) 
<P>
Remove the TiVoNet from your TiVo, and try booting again.  If it boots correctly,
and gives you a serial prompt, then your NIC card is most likely not setup correctly.
<P>
3. If it still doesn't give you a serial prompt, then put your TiVo's hard 
disk back on your PC and boot 
Dylan's boot disk and check that all the previous instructions have 
been followed.  If you found something wrong with your setup, then 
retry the reassembled TiVo with the TiVoNet card.  
<P>
If you can't find anything wrong with the setup, then
remove the "tivoether" predicate from rc.sysinit and reboot the reassembled
TiVo without the TiVoNet card and see if the serial prompt works.
<P>
If the serial prompt now works, then try loading the driver modules and configuring
the interface from the command prompt.
<P>
If the serial prompt still doesn't work, then you're not setting up 
the serial prompt correctly or not
correctly setting up the cable for the serial port, or not setting 
up your host terminal properly
for the serial commection, OR: you've got serious problems..
<P>
Otherwise, if you have a serial prompt and still can't telnet in...
<P>
4. Run:
<P>
<PRE>
	ps -auxww
</PRE>
This shows running processes.  See if the "tnlited" telnet daemon is running.  If not, start it up with:
<P>
<PRE>
 	tnlited 23 /bin/bash -login
</PRE>
There have been numerous reports of certain Windows and RedHat Linux 7.1 telnet clients that actually kill the TiVo telnet daemon.  If this is the case, see if you can find another telnet client for your host.
<P>
If you can ping your TiVo from your workstation ("ping &lt;ip address&gt;"), but you can't keep your telnet daemon running on the TiVo, then this is probably the problem.
<P>
Note that "ps" may not work if it's not in your "PATH" or uninstalled.  The "tivonetfloppy.zip" installation does install the "ps" command.  Also, the "ps" command is builtin to the "tivosh": enter the "tivosh" command, at its prompt, enter the above "ps" command.
<P>
5.  Check that the device drivers are loaded:
<P>
<PRE>
	cat /proc/modules
</PRE>
It should show output like:
<P>
<PRE>
	nfs                    51808   5
	tivone                  4508   1
	8390                    7264   0 [tivone]
	mixaud                  6124   1
	pxmpegdecode           50276   0 [mixaud]
	fpga7114              136996   0 (unused)
	therm                   1020   0 (unused)
	fan                      696   0
	i2c                     9848   0 [pxmpegdecode fpga7114 therm]
	ideturbo                2336   1
</PRE>
If either "tivone" or "8390" are not loaded, then there might be something wrong with the card.
<P>
Try loading the probe module:
<P>
<PRE>
	cat /proc/kmsg &amp;
	insmod -f /lib/modules/probe.o
</PRE>
and watch for errors.
<P>
6. Check if the ethernet interface is properly configured, type:
<P>
<PRE>
 	ifconfig
</PRE>
The resulting output should look like:
<P>
<PRE>
  	eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:80:48:ED:5B:88
          inet addr:192.168.1.53  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:297979 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:2144 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 coll:1
          Interrupt:29 Base address:0x300
</PRE>
Although your IP address will be different.  If your seeing TX packets, but no RX packets, you might have a broken interrupt on the NIC card.
<P>
7. Check the route.  This only effects getting out your gateway, and not getting between machines on your local lan, but check it out anyway.  Type:
<P>
<PRE>
 	route.tivo -n
</PRE>
It should respond with something like:
<P>
<PRE>
	Kernel IP routing table
	Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
	192.168.0.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     32767  0        0 eth0   
      	0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0  
</PRE>
The first line indicates the route to the local network.  It's saying: you can get to (in the example) "192.168.0.x" via eth0. This route is created by the ifconfig command.  If it's wrong, then something is wrong with the ifconfig statement you're using to configure the interface.
<P>
The second line indicates that you can get to anywhere (0.0.0.0 or x.x.x.x) by sending packets to the gateway, which is "192.168.0.1" (in the example).
<P>
8.  If the drivers are loaded, the interface is configured, and the telnet daemon is running, then go fix the workstation you were trying to telnet from!
