Welcome to Bill's Accumulated TiVo boot disk 1.6. Hack 'em if you got 'em!

This is a TiVo greatest hits CD, largely culled from Kazymyr's and
Johnny Death's, with various utilities and pre-packaged toolchains
added to the initrds and CD filesystem. 

NOTE: This CD is provided totally without warranty. Use at your own
      risk. It works for me. Your Mileage May Vary!

If you need to pass extra parameters to the kernel, enter them at the prompt
after the name of the kernel to boot (s1std, s1swap, or s2).  The kernel
will usually detect your hardware without requiring parameters.  Some 
examples of parameters are (where hdx can be any of hda through hdh):

   hdx=cyls,heads,sects,wpcom,irq  (for rare cases where probing fails)
   hdx=cdrom (force detection of an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drive) 

Available boot options:

  <enter>  Series 2 Kernel (TiVo Partition Support and Backups)
  s1swap   Series 1 Kernel with byteswapping enabled. (TiVo Partition Support)
  s1std    Series 1 Kernel without byteswapping, with DMA. (Backups)
